Structure Preparation:
---------------------

The structures employed here were prepared with the Desmond System Builder. The resulting .cms file was converted to .dms using the mae2dms utility:

$SCHRODINGER/run $SCHRODINGER/run -FROM desmond mae2dms  <struct>.cms <struct>.dms

In addition implicit solvation parameter tables (GB HCT model) were added using the included 'add_hct.py' utility using the parameters in the 'hct.param' file:

$SCHRODINGER/run add_hct.py 5dfr_opls_hct.dms


Tests
-----

python test_explicit.py

Performs 20ps of MD of a peptide in water starting with the structure 'als_peptide_opls_rst1.dms'. The final structure is 'als_peptide_opls_rst2.dms'. The trajectory is saved in  'als_peptide_opls.dcd'. Both can be inspected with vmd.

python test_implicit.py

Performs 80ps of MD of the 5dfr protein using the GB/HCT implicit solvent model. The initial structure is '5dfr_opls_hct_rst1.dms', the final structure is '5dfr_opls_hct_rst2.dms'. The trajectory is saved in  '5dfr.dcd'.
